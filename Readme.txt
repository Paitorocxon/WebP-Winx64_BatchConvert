This ZIP should contain 2 Files and 3 Folders.
the 2 Files are
"convert.bat" and "Readme.txt" (This File).

This Tool is made to convert a mass of different images like png, jpeg and so on (no gif) to webp format.

How do i convert my images to the webp format you ask?
Easy:
Drop every image you want to convert into the folder "drop images here" and double-click/open the "convert.bat" file.
When the script is started, it will ask you to give it some quality.
0 is poor
100 is 100% quality
easy? easy! Thank google!

Now your images shoul appear in the "converted"-folder in your requestes webp-format

# WebP-Winx64_BatchConvert
some small tiny batch file i've wrote to compress a mass of .PNGs


Because github does not allow empty folders in repositorys, but are neccessary for this script to work, you have to create both folder by your self.
"drop images here"
and
"converted"


I do not own any of the files inside the "libwebp-1.1.0-windows-x64" folder.
See the Readme inside this folder to learn more about the software.
